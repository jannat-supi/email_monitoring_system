# Project Title
Email Monitoring System
# Project Description
Email communication is one of the most preferred and most used platforms in the professional sector. As much as the usability of this platform grows, so do the security concerns. Because the possibility of using this platform as an attack vector for a cyberattack has also increased. So, we need to be more concerned about security, and this is how I connected with this project.
This project has two folded parts. One part is a spambot that is able to send spam emails to the recipient's email account. Actually, this part is a simulation of how this spambot can become an attack vector to address a DoS attack. Another part is a spam email detector that uses an ML model to detect whether an email is spam or not. In this section, we conducted a
comparative analysis of our model's performance evaluation with other ML algorithms. Our model's accuracy, which was 98.691%, was the highest of the rest.
